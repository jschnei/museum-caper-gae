================

Museum Caper in Google App Engine. Currently hosted at http://museumcaper.appspot.com . There is also a wiki at http://museumcaper.wikispaces.com/ .

## Setup

Google App Engine setup should be pretty easy in both Windows and Unix-based systems (downloading the appropriate file on https://developers.google.com/appengine/downloads should get you most of the way). More detailed setup instructions are available on the Wiki.
